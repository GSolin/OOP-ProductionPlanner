# OOP-ProductionPlanner

### Original creation: October, 2020

This project is a simple test in object oriented programming involving 
  - File input/output
  - Scanning/filtering text files 
  - Adding content of a text file to a buffer
  - Using data from a text file to carry out calculations
  - Creating an output file with all appropriate calculations made
  
This project took roughly two weeks to complete. It is very early on in my Computer Science course so it may a little rough or missing a few implementations.
